# MicrobiomeGWAS
## Introduction
Microbiome is a software package for identifying host genetic variants associated with micorbiome distance matrix or beta-diversity. For each SNP, Microbiome GWAS can test the main effect or the SNP-environment interaction. We found that the score statistics have positive skewness and kurtosis, which lead to severely inflated type_I error rates. We addressed the problem by correcting the skewness and kurtosis to derive an approximation. Simulations suggested that the P-value approxcimations are accurate even for P=10E-7.   

The current version requires three sets of files: PLINK binary genotype files, a distance matrix and a set of covariates, e.g., PCAs for adjusting population stratefication. The current version does not support genotypic dosages. 

Microbiome is very fast,
